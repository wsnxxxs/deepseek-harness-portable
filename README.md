## Why DeepSeek Harness Desktop?

Upstream [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) is primarily designed for POSIX shells and containerized environments. This distribution adds a native Electron shell, platform-specific runtime adapters, verified release packaging, and a manual release path. Upstream adaptations remain isolated behind reviewed patches and Cordis extension points.

The packaged application includes its own Electron/Node.js runtime, stores user data outside the application directory, and provides desktop integrations such as workspace selection, update diagnostics, the plugin marketplace, vision tools, and the Interactive Learning preset.

## Platform support

| Platform | Package | Minimal shell | Update behavior | Important requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Windows x64 | Setup or portable ZIP | Bash through WSL | Checks for releases and opens the release page for manual installation | A working default WSL distribution with Bash |
| macOS Apple Silicon | DMG | Native `/bin/bash` through a POSIX PTY | Checks for releases and opens the release page for manual installation | Current DMG is unsigned and not notarized |
| Linux x64 | AppImage or deb | Native `/bin/bash` through a POSIX PTY | Checks for releases and opens the release page for manual installation | Sandboxed modes require a usable bwrap/Landlock backend |

Packages include the application runtime; users do not need to install Node.js or pnpm. Build prerequisites are listed separately under [Build and release](#build-and-release).

## Quick start

1. Download the Windows Setup/ZIP, `DeepSeek-Harness-<version>-darwin-arm64.dmg`, or `DeepSeek-Harness-<version>-linux-x64.AppImage` from the [latest release](https://github.com/wsnxxxs/deepseek-harness-portable/releases/latest).
2. On Windows, run the installer. On Linux/macOS, download and inspect the release's `install.sh`, then run `sh install.sh`; manual AppImage/deb and DMG installation remains available.
3. Launch **DeepSeek Harness** and open **Settings** in the Web UI to add your DeepSeek API key (or provide it in the environment before launching).

Before first launch, verify the checksum published alongside the artifact. Windows users who need Minimal mode should also verify that `wsl -- bash -lc true` succeeds.

## Features

- Bundled native Electron desktop shell with the built-in DeepSeek Harness Web runtime, served on the loopback address.
- Workspace selection, browser mode, tray/app menu, update history, About, and diagnostics export.
- Release checks with a compact new-version notice and a release-page link; application files are never downloaded or replaced by the desktop shell.
- Native sidebar logo and system theme sync, Windows 11 Mica/title-bar styling, native macOS menus, a staged startup splash, and persisted multi-monitor-safe window bounds.
- Minimal mode uses WSL Bash on Windows and the native `/bin/bash` POSIX PTY on Linux/macOS. Linux sandbox-capable modes use bwrap or fail-closed Landlock according to the upstream policy.
- Preinstalled, removable plugin marketplace with paginated GitHub search, one-click installation, update management, and agent-facing market tools.
- Vision Bridge's `view_image` analyzes local PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF files through the kernel attachment and model services. It can automatically select a configured image-capable model—including the official `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` catalog entry—or pin one in plugin settings, with no separate endpoint or API key.
- The conversation input accepts pasted, dropped, or selected images, PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, text, data, and common source-code files. Documents are extracted locally, retained with the session, and exposed to the model through a bounded preview plus `read_attachment` continuation reads; OCR and legacy Office formats are not included.
- Learning mode provides non-blocking semantic visuals, selective understanding checks, and session-scoped learning routes. Teaching state advances from learner evidence and survives refresh, resume, and message compaction.
- Usage settings summarize token consumption, model breakdowns, activity, and session timing from durable runtime projections.

## Install

1. **Windows Setup installer:** download `DeepSeek-Harness-Setup-<version>-win32-x64.exe` from Releases and run it.
2. **Windows online installer:** run `install.ps1` from this repository. It only accepts a release ZIP with a trusted SHA-256 digest. Options: `-InstallDir <path>` (default `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\DeepSeek Harness`), `-NoDesktopShortcut`, `-Force`.
3. **Windows portable ZIP:** download `DeepSeek-Harness-<version>-win32-x64.zip`, verify `SHA256SUMS.txt`, then extract the complete directory without renaming `runtime`.
4. **Verified Linux/macOS install:** download `install.sh` and `SHA256SUMS-install.txt` from the same release, verify the script, inspect it, then run `sh install.sh`. It selects only the supported native target and verifies the AppImage/DMG against `SHA256SUMS-<target>.txt` before installation. Linux defaults to `~/.local/opt/deepseek-harness` plus `~/.local/bin/deepseek-harness` and a desktop entry; macOS defaults to `~/Applications`. Use `--version <version>`, `--install-dir <path>`, or `--help` as needed.
5. **macOS Apple Silicon (manual):** download `DeepSeek-Harness-<version>-darwin-arm64.dmg`, verify `SHA256SUMS-darwin-arm64.txt`, open it, and drag the app to **Applications**. The DMG is currently unsigned and not notarized; the installer does not bypass Gatekeeper.
6. **Linux x64 AppImage (manual):** download `DeepSeek-Harness-<version>-linux-x64.AppImage`, verify its checksum, run `chmod +x DeepSeek-Harness-<version>-linux-x64.AppImage`, and launch it.
7. **Linux x64 deb (manual):** download `DeepSeek-Harness-<version>-linux-x64.deb` and install it with `sudo apt install ./DeepSeek-Harness-<version>-linux-x64.deb`. After installation, launch it from a terminal with `dsh`.
8. **Uninstall:** use the platform's normal app removal flow. Windows uninstall scripts are included; user data is kept unless explicitly removed.

> **Note:** `setup-shortcuts.ps1` (called by the installer and by `创建桌面快捷方式.bat` in the portable package) creates a desktop shortcut that targets the no-console GUI launcher and adds the portable directory to your **user PATH**. The uninstaller removes both.

The installer and updater verify the ZIP digest, release manifest, application manifest, and required native modules. They do not create certificates or modify Windows trust stores.

Do not delete or rename the Windows `runtime` directory. macOS uses the normal `.app` bundle layout instead.

Linux AppImage and deb packages contain the native Electron runtime and desktop entry. The deb package also registers `/usr/local/bin/dsh` for terminal startup. The unpacked Linux build includes `start-desktop.sh`, `start-web.sh`, `dsh.sh`, and `portable-pnpm.sh` beside `runtime/` for terminal-driven use.

## User data and API key

- Sessions, credentials, settings, attachments, and desktop preferences live **outside the application directory**, under `%USERPROFILE%\.dsh` on Windows or `$HOME/.dsh` on Linux/macOS (override with the `DSH_HOME` environment variable). They survive updates and are kept on uninstall unless you explicitly remove them.
- Configure your DeepSeek API key in the Web UI **Settings**, or provide it in the environment of the launching process.
- The desktop shell binds the Web service to the loopback address and sets `DSH_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`.

## Launch and update

- Windows shortcuts and portable users launch `DeepSeek Harness Launcher.exe`, which keeps update recovery available without opening a command window. `start-desktop.cmd` remains the console diagnostics fallback. Linux uses the AppImage/deb desktop entry or the unpacked `start-desktop.sh`; macOS launches the app from **Applications**.
- Windows `start-web.cmd` (or `启动网页版.bat`) and Linux `start-web.sh` start the Web surface through the embedded Electron/Node runtime; no system Node.js installation is required.
- Windows `dsh.cmd` provides the same web entry plus the embedded plugin-management CLI and distribution subcommands: `dsh update`, `dsh desktop`, `dsh trust`.
- The desktop tray menu provides **Check for Updates**, **Release Notes**, and **About**.
- When a new release is found, the desktop shell shows a transient notice and opens the release page on request. It never downloads, replaces, or rolls back the installed application; users install the new package manually.
- Release notices can be suppressed per version; Release Notes and About open in a card-style release information panel. See the [release notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md) for the product history.

## FAQ

**Why does Windows say the executable is unsigned?**
The desktop executable is currently not signed by a trusted commercial CA, so SmartScreen may warn about it. Verify the published SHA-256 values (see [Security and limitations](#security-and-limitations)), then choose **More info → Run anyway**. This project deliberately does not create self-signed certificates or modify trust stores.

**What is Smart App Control, and can this run at all?**
Smart App Control may block unsigned apps outright. If it is enabled on your device, you may need to turn it off for this app, or use an enterprise-approved, CA-signed build. See Microsoft's [Smart App Control overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/develop/smart-app-control/overview).

**Do I need Node.js installed?**
No. Desktop mode, browser/Web mode, the DSH plugin CLI, and pnpm all use the Node.js runtime embedded in Electron.

**Where is my data stored?**
Under `%USERPROFILE%\.dsh` (or `$DSH_HOME`), outside the application directory. See [User data and API key](#user-data-and-api-key).

**A release check failed — what now?**
The release information panel shows an error state with a retry action and does not block the main window. You can also open the project release page and download the latest platform artifact manually. Windows portable users may still run the standalone updater directly: `dsh update`, `在线更新.bat`, or `update.ps1`.

**Does macOS Minimal mode require WSL or Docker?**
No. On Apple Silicon, Minimal mode uses the native POSIX PTY and `/bin/bash`, with the macOS runtime's native process and sandbox support.

**Does Linux Minimal mode require WSL or Docker?**
No. Linux uses its native POSIX PTY and `/bin/bash`. Sandboxed modes use the upstream `bwrap` runner when available and fail closed to Landlock when the fallback is selected; an unavailable enforcement backend is not silently downgraded to an unsandboxed run.

**Why did a long command time out in Minimal mode?**
Minimal mode runs the requested shell command unchanged. Recursive `grep` over the vendored workspace also traverses nested dependency trees and can legitimately exceed the tool timeout; prefer `rg` (which respects ignore files) or exclude `node_modules`. On Windows, the desktop bridge force-stops only that terminal's `wsl.exe` process tree; Linux/macOS terminate the native POSIX PTY.

## Build and release

*For maintainers and contributors.*

Requirements: Node.js ^22.19.0 or >=24 and pnpm. Windows release builds run on Windows x64; macOS release builds run on Apple Silicon macOS and use `hdiutil`, `sips`, and `iconutil`; Linux release builds run on native Linux x64 with `musl-gcc`, `bwrap`/Landlock test support, and `dpkg-deb` for the deb lane. `electron-builder` supplies the AppImage/deb packaging layer.

This repository includes the matching DeepSeek Harness source workspace as a pinned Git submodule at `vendor/deepseek-harness`. It supplies the `@deepseek-ai/*` packages and builds the embedded Web runtime locally; the release process does not need an existing portable ZIP as its build input.

On a fresh clone, initialize the source workspace once:

    pnpm run desktop:bootstrap

When generated `lib`/`dist` artifacts already exist, daily feature work can
refresh only the desktop runtime dependency closure with:

    pnpm run desktop:bootstrap:dev

This faster mode is not a replacement for the full dependency set required by
a from-scratch kernel build or release package.

After that, package on the matching native host. Packaging runs the real capability probes, writes the measured mode catalog and file inventory, retests the manifest-bearing application bytes, creates the platform containers, and finally writes an immutable verified bundle:

    pnpm run desktop:package:win

The verified Windows bundle is written to `dist-desktop/verified/win32-x64/`. Publishing is a separate copy-only operation and requires that directory explicitly:

    pnpm run desktop:release:win -- --input dist-desktop/verified/win32-x64

For macOS Apple Silicon DMG builds, use:

    pnpm run desktop:package:mac
    pnpm run desktop:release:mac -- --input dist-desktop/verified/darwin-arm64

For Linux x64 AppImage and deb builds, run on a native Linux x64 host:

    pnpm run desktop:package:linux
    pnpm run desktop:release:linux -- --input dist-desktop/verified/linux-x64

The Linux command writes the unpacked runtime to
`dist-desktop/electron/DeepSeek Harness-linux-x64/` and the release artifacts to
`dist-desktop/electron/linux-artifacts/`. The official upstream Landlock launcher
is compiled locally with `musl-gcc` and staged into the Linux runtime; a missing
launcher or unusable Landlock kernel remains fail-closed at runtime.

Packaging fingerprints the source workspace and reuses successful compile, deployed-runtime, patch, and Electron layers when their inputs have not changed. Pass `--no-cache` to a package command when diagnosing a clean build; `--skip-build` remains available when intentionally packaging existing compiled output. Release commands do not accept build flags, run tests, patch files, sign files, or recreate archives: they re-hash and copy only the exact files named by `artifact-verification.json`.

The desktop package keeps three version identities:

- `distributionVersion`: the public release tag plus the platform-specific ZIP, Setup, AppImage/deb, or DMG artifact.
- desktop shell version: the Electron shell package version.
- kernel version: the packaged `@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app` version.

The native package CI matrix is the authority for platform support: Linux runs on native Linux x64, Windows uses a native x64 runner with a working WSL distribution and Inno Setup, and macOS uses a native Apple Silicon runner. A cross-built or locally unmeasured artifact cannot receive a verification record. The release workflow consumes those records without rebuilding.

Current local packages are classified `non-official-unsigned`. Official publishing fails closed until target-specific evidence is attached: Authenticode for Windows, signing plus notarization for macOS, and external package signing for Linux. `--allow-non-official` is an explicit maintainer override for a prerelease; it never changes the classification. See [Runtime architecture and release gates](docs/runtime-architecture.md). When preparing a release, update `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.zh.md`, and `apps/desktop/src/release-notes.json` together.

`dist-desktop/` is a generated build directory and may be deleted after a release. The source needed for the next build remains in `vendor/deepseek-harness`; do not commit `node_modules/` or a portable ZIP as a substitute for the source workspace.

## Security and limitations

- Verify the published SHA-256 values before running downloaded files.
- Current local Windows, Linux, and macOS packages are explicitly non-official and unsigned; the official release lane refuses them without the TargetSpec signing/notarization evidence.
- The local web server binds to loopback by default.
- Do not put API keys in the repository or release directory.
- Marketplace entries are third-party code discovered from GitHub. Review a plugin's repository and permissions before installing it; installation can run package build scripts and grants the plugin the capabilities of its Cordis composition.
- If trusted executables are required, use an approved CA, Microsoft Artifact Signing, or an enterprise signing policy.
